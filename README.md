# Wumpus World 
Step into the mysterious and thrilling world of Wumpus, where every move could be your last. Are you brave enough to outwit the lurking beast in this classic reimagined adventure?

## What is the Wumpus?
In the heart of a dark, labyrinthine cave system lies the Wumpus, a legendary creature that stalks the shadows. Based on the iconic computer game Hunt the Wumpus, this strategic hide-and-seek challenge pits players against the fearsome monster in a deadly game of survival. Originally created as a text-based adventure in BASIC, the Wumpus has evolved over time, captivating generations of players with graphical remakes and imaginative twists.

But beware, the Wumpus is cunning. It wonâ€™t be easy to navigate the maze of perilous pits, poisonous gases, and uncharted rooms. Your goal? Hunt the Wumpus before it hunts you.
